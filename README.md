A simple caesar cipher.

What is caesar cipher ?

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

*******************************************************
I made it on my own without any help whatsoever from google/youtube/tutorials[of which i am very proud of :) ]. Maybe the things i did can be done in a less complicated way.
So don't start with "This can be done like this/ yaar ye toh bahot complicated hai isko toh dusre tareeke se easily kiya ja skta".     I made it just for fun.

I did not keep in mind the complexities of the program.

Code can be / or is messy. I did not implemented error handling(I am lazy). so beware of unexpected outputs. But as long as you are not doing anything wrong deliberately , it should be fine.

If you think you can make the code more efficient or add more features. Go Ahead and do it and tell me about it too!!    :)
